sidux-art-erebos (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * Initial Release.
  * add actual normal aspect ratio wallpaper version
  * add kdm artwork - there are binaries there that need to go 
       but they're there as a template until debian/rules is sorted
  * remove no session and menu buttons (cruft from nyx kdm template)
  * add kdm export svg to bitmap code to debian/rules 
  * add copyright info
  * add ksplash export info to debian/rules
  * adjust ksplash source so coordinates are easily exportable
  * configure ksplash Theme.rc to correct name/contact info
  * add gdm theme conf - can reuse the bitmaps from kdm
  * revert unneeded gdm stuff in debian/rules 
  * make dm part of debian/rules output to non-kde specific dir as per above
    bitmap reuse
  * move ksplash and xfce theme control scripts out of their temp binary dirs
  * add package*.install conf files
  * change the dump of all binary files from tmp into their respective dirs in
    the $CURDIR to workaround issue with gdm failing to build
  * rename wallpaper/*.svg to format dictated by previous packages sidux-*
  * change spelling in desc of Xfce splash pkg to resolve lintian warning
  * packages are building with:
  svn-buildpackage --svn-ignore --svn-no-links --svn-builder=debuild -us -uc -sa
  * add a gdm screenshot  
  * make the screenshot install in .install script
  * add jpg screenshot to dm-kdm section to avoid clobbering with *.png
    regexps
  * update kdm .install and .greeters to handle it
  * remove hardcoded ksplash bitmaps, mv Preview.png into root dir (this will
    be clobbered by *.png regexps, I don't know what consequences that will
    have)
  * remove hardcoded xfce splash bitmaps

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * remove unnecessary build-dep on cdbs.
  * fix lintian warnings regarding the correct Xfce spelling.
